# Personal Notes

Personal Notes is a web app to receive and show notes that other people send
you.

Yes, it's basically a bad messaging system.

## Background :)

I used to write little daily notes for my girlfriend, which she loved. It went
on for about 6 months (not every single day but pretty consistent), then we had
summer break, and it was just kinda hard picking up after that. She recently
requested that I revive the trend, but now that we're long distance, I thought
I'd solve a few issues with little pieces of paper by writing a web app that is
permanent and digitally accessible. And here it is.

## Minor Issues

Although I've written web apps before, I wanted to introduce an extra challenge
for myself with this one by learning a new framework I hadn't used before. I had
done one React project before, but wanted to try React TypeScript instead. After
doing some research I discovered [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which seemed to
be promising. However after a few days of looking into it I got a little
overwhelmed by the amount of new things I would need to learn (React, which I
last used two years ago; TypeScript, which I only used for two months over a
year ago; Next.js specifics; some backend server framework and how Next.js deals
with that; a TypeScript ORM; etc.), and so I simply went back to my default
familiar stack of Python + Flask + Jinja2. Also by the time I made that
decision, I had "accidentally" told her I had a surprise for her, and she had
already been asking what it was for a while...

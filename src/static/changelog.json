      "Sometimes things wouldn't work during the first database request after a server restart. This change fixes that.",
      "Technical explanation: Render spins down free tier web services after inactivity, so the server was restarting quite often. It turns out SQLAlchemy's default connection pooling is unable to retrigger after a server restart, and then crashes when trying to use the now-invalid connections during the first request after a restart. Adding an option to pre-ping before every connection should fix the issue."
